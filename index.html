        <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, we are very proud of what we built in the time we had,
          regarding both design and functionality. The component-based
          architecture and data-driven design allowed us to create a solid
          foundation for a Pokemon-style game. However, if we had 8 more weeks
          to work on this project, there are two main areas we would focus on:
          game depth/complexity and mechanics improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of complexity, we would significantly expand the game's
          content and systems. This would include adding a larger roster of
          Pokemon with more diverse characteristics, implementing a type system
          with advantages/weaknesses, and expanding the move pool beyond basic
          attacks. We would also develop a more advanced storyline with
          increased NPC interactions, more areas to explore, and add quest
          chains. Additional Pokemon features like evolution, status effects,
          and special abilities would bring the game closer to the depth of the
          original Pokemon games.
        </p>
        <p>
          For game mechanics, we would focus on technical improvements and tool
          enhancement. This would include adding more sophisticated battle
          animations, particle effects for moves, and smoother transition
          animations between states. We would expand our Python-based game maker
          to support all entity types, allowing for easier creation of NPCs,
          items, and environmental objects. Additional tool improvements would
          include an animation editor for creating and modifying sprite
          animations, a battle move creator for designing new attacks, and a
          more comprehensive map editor with support for indoor areas and
          environmental variations.
